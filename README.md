## About:       
Yoshinon ~~(よしのん)~~ is a whiptail-like dialog box written with Bubble Tea (Go).          
The command-line usage is very similar to dialog/whiptail.      
## Usage:
As we all know, premature optimization is the root of all evil, so this will be done after I get all the modules working.
